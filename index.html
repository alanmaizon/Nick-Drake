    <li>
        <dl><dt>Pink Moon(1972)</dt>
            <dd>Pink Moon sold fewer copies than its predecessors, although it received some favourable reviews. In Zigzag, Connor McKnight wrote: "Nick Drake is an artist who never fakes. The album makes no concession to the theory that music should be escapist. It's simply one musician's view of life at the time, and you can't ask for more than that."</dd>

    <li>
        <dl><dt>Bryter Layter(1971)</dt>
            <dd>Bryter Layter was a commercial failure, and reviews were again mixed; Record Mirror praised Drake as a "beautiful guitaristâ€”clean and with perfect timing, [and] accompanied by soft, beautiful arrangements", but Melody Maker described the album as "an awkward mix of folk and cocktail jazz"</dd>
        </dl>
    </li>
    <li>
        <dl><dt>Five Leaves Left(1969)</dt>
            <dd> Melody Maker described Five Leaves Left as "poetic" and "interesting", though NME wrote in October that there was "not nearly enough variety to make it entertaining"</dd>
